# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains Areeta's portfolio and STEP projects.
This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.

# Intro

This repo has three main directories:

- portfolio (a directory to host the main website for week 2's project)
- test (a directory to hold all test files)
- walkthroughs (a directory to hold week 1-5 instructions)

To get started:

- Login to [Google Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor)
- Clone this repo: `cd; git clone https://github.com/googleinterns/step.git`
- Open the GitHub setup walkthrough: `teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-1-setup/github-setup-walkthrough.md`
  - If the tutorial panel does not open or display the walkthrough contents, try refreshing the page.

Then follow the on-screen instructions to set up your repo.

## Google Cloud Shell

[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is a set of tools that lets you run
code on the same computers that run Google. There are many ways to use Google
Cloud: as a Java library, as a standalone tool, or as a service.

[Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) is one way to interact with
Google Cloud. Cloud Shell gives you a
[code editor](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/viewing-and-editing-files)
that lets you edit files, and a command line window to run commands. You can
think of Cloud Shell as a window into a computer running inside of Google Cloud.
You're going to use Cloud Shell over the next few weeks to write, build, and run
your code.

If you see `Cloud Shell` in the upper-left corner and you're reading this text
in a panel on the right, then you're already using Cloud Shell!

## Cloud Shell Editor

Cloud Shell comes with a built-in code editor that allows you to browse file
directories and view and edit files.

The editor displays the directory structure in its left-hand panel. You'll learn
more about these files throughout STEP, but for now try clicking around to
explore. Try opening the
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="step/walkthroughs/week-1-setup/intro-walkthrough.md">
  intro-walkthrough.md
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file to view the source for this walkthrough!

You'll be using the Cloud Shell editor quite a bit in the coming weeks, so take
some time to familiarize yourself now. You can read more about Cloud Shell
Editor [here](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/viewing-and-editing-files).

## Command Line

Cloud Shell also comes with a command line console that lets you run commands in
Google Cloud.

You can type commands into the console to run programs, compile your code, and
deploy to Google Cloud.

If you're new to the command line, that's okay! You'll learn about some other
commands soon, and you can also Google "command line commands" for some other
resources.
